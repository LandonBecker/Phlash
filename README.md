Introduction

Context: Bacteriophages are diverse, actively-evolving entities that represent most organisms in the biosphere. Every year, students and faculty members at universities across the nation participate in the Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) program (Figure 1) to identify and annotate novel bacteriophage genomes for GenBank submission. 

Problem: Current genome annotation tools (Figure 2) used by participants of SEA-PHAGES do not optimize gene prediction and therefore require hours of manual reexamination of the entire genome. Researchers must painstakingly parse through each open reading frame using visual comparisons, while making sure that all coding potential regions are accounted for. This process is often prone to error. 

Solution: We are developing a web application called Phlash, which reduces the manual challenges by combining functionalities of current tools and outputting submission-ready GenBank files. Phlash efficiently automates and promises to dramatically accelerate the pace of bacteriophage genome annotation. Phage hunters will then be able to spend less time annotating and more time contributing to our knowledge on the genetic diversity of bacteriophages and their implications.Â
