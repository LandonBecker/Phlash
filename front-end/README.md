# Phlash - client

## Project setup

The best way to run this app is via Docker.
First, edit the file called `.env.production` to point to the API (back end) server.
Run the `build_docker` script to build the Docker image.
Then execute the `run_docker` script to start the front-end server.
This script is configured to run the server on port 5050.
You can change that to whatever you wish.
